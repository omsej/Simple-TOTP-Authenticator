# Simple-TOTP-Authenticator
Just a bare minimum totp code generator

## Warning:
Do not actually use this to authenticate your apps or social media! this is a bare minimum demonstrator of how otp works!
This code does not have a secure database to store secrets so it is not secure for actual use in it's current state.

## The optkey.py file:
Generates a base32 code to input into authenticator apps or Auth_app.py

## Auth_app.py:
Converts the base32 code into realtime TOTP 6 digit code.

Just to verify everything is working, you can add the base32 code generated by potkey.py into the text of both Auth_app.py and an authenticator app like google authenticator and compare TOTP generated. 
You can also add QR code generation or syntax to add profile information.
Lastly, if this code is being added to any project, create a secure Database to store all secrets.
